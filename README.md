# MonsterPot ðŸŒ±

**MonsterPot** is an intelligent plant pot system that helps monitor and manage plant growth conditions using advanced technology. The system is powered by Arduino for real-time sensor data collection and control. The application is built with TypeScript and React, leveraging MQTT for efficient communication between devices and a backend implemented with Express and MongoDB for data storage and processing. Additionally, MonsterPot is a Progressive Web App (PWA) enhanced with smooth animations created using Framer Motion, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Features

### Core Features:
- **Sensor Data Retrieval**: View real-time data including temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture.
- **Automated Watering**: The device automatically waters the plant when the soil moisture falls below a predefined percentage threshold, ensuring optimal hydration.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: The system constantly monitors light intensity and temperature, sending real-time alerts for any critical deviations via in-app and email notifications.
- **History Section**:
  - Track the last watering date.
  - Notifications for errors such as low water level, high temperature, or insufficient light.
- **Statistics Section**:
  - Average temperature.
  - Last watering date and total number of waterings.
  - Line chart showing daily watering percentage (%).
